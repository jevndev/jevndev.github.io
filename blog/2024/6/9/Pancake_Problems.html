							Recently I read through
							<em>
								The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets
							</em>
							by Simon Singh. On top of being a fun reminder of a
							lot of episodes from the golden age of the show, it
							is a fantastic survey of many subjects and anecdotes
							in math. It's a great read even if you don't think
							you have all of the background knowledge as Simon is
							very good about giving a quick overview of
							prerequisite knowledge for the various topics he
							touches on. One topic in particular infected me.
							That is, the titular Pancake Problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							The
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting"
							>
								Pancake Problem
							</a>
							goes like this: You're given a stack of pancakes all
							of different sizes, but they're in a random order.
							You want to modify the stack so that they are
							ordered from largest on the bottom to smallest on
							the top, making a visually pleasing pyramid.
							However, the only way you can modify the stack is to
							stick your spatula in-between two pancakes and flip
							everything above your spatula in one go. With this
							setup in mind, the problem asks "What is the minimum
							number of flips required for an arbitrary stack of
							size
							<em> N </em>
							". That minimum count is known as the "Pancake
							number" of
							<em> N </em>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is one of those problems which I find
							absolutely beautiful. Similar to something like the
							<a href="https://xkcd.com/710/">
								time consuming and relationship destroying
								Collatz conjecture
							</a>
							or the
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem"
							>
								Moving Sofa Problem
							</a>
							it's one of those things that's explainable in a few
							sentences but with a solution which is surprisingly
							rich in depth. There are permutations of the problem
							(see the Wikipedia page linked above) but I find the
							base problem very elegant. However, a closed form
							for the Pancake number of
							<em> N </em>
							is still yet to be found. We have brute forced quite
							a few (22 at the time of writing) values, but you
							can imagine that checking every sequence of flips on
							every permutation of N pancakes is very costly.
							Upper and lower bounds have been found and slowly
							squeezed over time with the hope that eventually
							they will meet in the middle and give us our closed
							form.
						</p>
						<p>
							After reading about this problem, I found myself
							thinking about it a lot over the coming days. I
							decided to not look into any of the progress the
							mathematics community has made and try my hand at
							it. I figured it wasn't likely that I would find a
							solution, but maybe I could get some unexplored
							ideas.
						</p>
						<h1>Formalization</h1>
						<p>
							I wanted to formalize the problem to get some rigor
							to it. I eventually came to a formal definition of
							the stack of pancakes:
						</p>
						<p>
							$$S_n=(s_i: s_i \in [1,n])\ s.t.\ \forall j\in[1,n]\
							\exists s_i=j\ \land |S_n| = n$$ Or in English,
							$S_n$ is a sequence of natural numbers from $1$ to
							$n$ where each in that range are present once and
							only once. I then called the set of all valid
							$S_n$-s "$\mathbb{S}_n$".
						</p>
						<p>
							I then rigorously defined this "flip" operation and
							came to the following:
						</p>
						<p>
							$$F_k(S_n) = {f_{k,n}(s_i): \forall i \in S_n} $$
							where
						</p>
						<p>
							$$ f_{k,n}(s_i) = \begin{cases} s_i&amp; i&lt;k\\
							s_{n-i+k}&amp; i\geq k \end{cases} $$
						</p>
						<p>
							This then results in a sequence of flips (like the
							one which yields the pancake number of $N$) being
							defined as a chain of compositions of various
							$F_k$-s. I decided to define a sequence of $m$ flips
							as:
						</p>
						<p>
							$$ \textbf{F}(S_n)=(F_{j_1}\circ F_{j_2} \circ
							\ldots \circ F_{j_{m-1}} \circ F_{j_m})(S_n) $$
						</p>
						<p>
							What is not immediately intuitive is that, since
							composition is commonly defined as right
							associative, you would read this sequence of flips
							from right to left. I also, for convenience of this
							problem, use $|\textbf{F}|$ to denote the number of
							functions composed in this sequence.
						</p>
						<p>
							Further, I said that the set of all possible
							$\textbf{F}$-s for a given $n$ to be $\mathbb{F}_n$.
							Lastly, I defined some special objects in these
							sets:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									The "Target Stack" is simply the sorted
									sequence of pancakes
								</p>
								<p>$$ \bar{S}_n={1, 2, \ldots, n-1, n} $$</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The "Solution Stack" $S^*_n$ is the initial
									condition stack which corresponds to the
									pancake number of n
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								And the "Solution Sequence" $\textbf{F}^*_n$ is
								the sequence of moves which gets the solution
								stack to the target stack
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>$$ \bar{S}_n=\textbf{F}^*_n(S^*_n) $$</p>
						<p>
							Finally we can get to the formal definition of the
							pancake number $P(n)$. All it is is:
						</p>
						<p>
							$$
							P(n)=\max_{S_n\in\mathbb{S_n}}\min_{\textbf{F}\in\mathbb{F}_n}|\textbf{F}(S_n)|\
							s.t.\ \textbf{F}(S_n) = \bar{S}_n $$
						</p>
						<p>
							Again in English: "Take every permutation of
							pancakes of length $n$, take every possible sequence
							of flips which result in the target stack when
							applied to the permutation and the length of the
							smallest sequence of flips is the pancake number"
						</p>
						<h1>Playing Around</h1>
						<h2>Finding the Inverse of a Flip</h2>
						<p>
							Immediately, I wanted to show the intuition that
							applying the same flip twice resulted in the same
							stack you started with. With the above definition,
							this is equivalent to proving that $F_k$ is its own
							inverse. That is:
						</p>
						<p>$$(F_k \circ F_k) (S_n) = S_n$$</p>
						<p>
							This is actually fairly trivial to prove just from
							the definition of $F_k$. Note that:
						</p>
						<p>
							$$(F_k \circ F_k)(S_n) = {f_{k,n}(f_{k,n}(s_i)):\
							\forall s_i \in S_n}$$
						</p>
						<p>
							$$ f_{k,n}(f_{k,n}(s_i))=\begin{cases} s_i&amp;
							i&lt;k \\ s_{n-(n-i+k)+k} &amp; i\geq k \end{cases}
							$$
						</p>
						<p>i.e.</p>
						<p>
							$$ f_{k,n}(f_{k,n}(s_i))=\begin{cases} s_i&amp;
							i&lt;k \\ s_{i} &amp; i\geq k \end{cases} = s_i $$
						</p>
						<p>
							What's neat about this conclusion is that it
							illuminates a bit about what the solution sequence
							looks like. The solution sequence cannot have any
							two subsequent flips of the same $k$, because they
							would simply collapse to the identity function.
						</p>
						<h2>Finding more properties</h2>
						<p>
							There was one invariant that I noticed that I
							figured could be helpful. From the definition of
							$f_{k,n}$ , every element in a stack below $k$ is
							untouched. Given the definition of a sequence of
							flips (copied from above):
						</p>
						<p>
							$$ \textbf{F}(S
							<em> n)=(F </em>
							{j
							<em> 1}\circ F </em>
							{j
							<em> 2} \circ \ldots \circ F </em>
							{j
							<em> {m-1}} \circ F </em>
							{j
							<em>
								m})(S_n)$$ It follows that $$ \textbf{F}(S_n) =
								[s_1, s_2, \ldots , s
							</em>
							{k-1}]\ |\ R $$ where $k=\min_{j_{i}\ i &lt; m}i$ ,
							$|$ represents concatenation of sequences and $R$ is
							some sequence of the elements of the elements of
							$S_n$ not in the first sequence of the
							concatenation. In clearer words, all elements below
							the lowest flip in a given sequence are untouched.
						</p>
						<p>
							This actually immediately results in the conclusion
							that the solution stack cannot start with a
							subsequence of ordered terms. The proof of this is
							simple, as you can take any stack of this type and
							trivially make a "worse" stack (and thus one which
							would result in a higher pancake number) by flipping
							over the whole thing.
						</p>
						<p>
							That conclusion then leads to the conclusion that,
							since a stack which starts with just the 1st element
							in the right place fits the above definition, the
							first element cannot be in place for the solution
							stack. And since you cannot modify the bottom
							element without flipping the whole stack (see the
							invariant described above), the solution sequence
							<em> must </em>
							involve $F_1$
						</p>
						<p>
							Great, so we now know $P(n) &gt; 1\ :\ n\neq1$ .
							Good work.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was then thinking about an upper bound.
							Immediately, a strategy to solve any sequence comes
							to mind.
						</p>
						<pre><code>for each element i from 1 to n:
    find s_k=i
    perform F_k
    perform F_i
</code></pre>
						<p>
							Note that at each iteration, this strategy moves the
							"target pancake" to the top of the stack and then
							sends it to the bottom of the unsorted stack. This
							algorithm does 2 flips for each pancake so we now
							now $P(n)\leq2n$
						</p>
						<p>
							That's some pretty good progress! Let's finally take
							a look at what the rest of the mathematicians have
							figured out. Just a quick glance at that Wikipedia
							page and....
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								The minimum number of flips required to sort any
								stack of
								<em> n </em>
								pancakes has been shown to lie between
								$\frac{15}{14n}$ and $\frac{18}{11n}$
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>oh.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								In 2011, ... [it was] prove[n] that the problem
								of finding the shortest sequence of flips for a
								given stack of pancakes is NP-Hard
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>oh.</p>
						<h2>Other Discoveries</h2>
						<p>
							Small road block. I don't understand how I haven't
							managed to get as good of answers as 50 years of
							much more qualified people working on this problem.
							I mean I spent a whole weekend thinking about this!
							Oh well. Some other neat discoveries I made before
							checking out some other resources are:
						</p>
						<h3>Graph Representation</h3>
						<p>
							You can represent the problem in a bit of a
							different way by considering a bi-graph where each
							node is a permutation of pancakes of length $n$. and
							there exists edges between two nodes where a flip
							can convert one sequence into the other. This
							re-frames the problem as finding the furthest node
							from the node corresponding to the target stack and
							finding the length of the shortest path from that
							node to the node of the target stack. Certainly you
							could use some graph theory machinery to make some
							progress-

							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting#Pancake_graphs"
							>
								Oh
							</a>
						</p>
						<h3>Cycling entries</h3>
						<p>
							I found a neat property that you can do a right
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift"
							>
								circular shift
							</a>
							of a subsequence $[s_i, s_{i+1},
							\ldots,s_{j-1},s_j]$ by applying the sequence $f_k
							\circ f_{k=1} \circ \ldots \circ f_{i+1} \circ f_i$
							. Similarly, the reverse sequence rotates that
							subsequence left.
						</p>
						<h3>Uniqueness of the Solution Sequence</h3>
						<p>
							While playing around, I ran into a handful of
							postulates which I could only prove to the point of
							depending on the uniqueness of a solution sequence
							$\textbf{F}^*_n$. That is, that there is only one
							sequence which corresponds the pancake number
							$P(n)$. Try as I might, I was unable to definitively
							prove this. Maybe someone else out there has an idea
							or maybe I just haven't reframed the problem right
						</p>
						<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
						<p>
							Despite the lack of real solid progress on this
							problem, it was fun to think about. When I stumble
							across problems like this I really do like to try to
							tackle them myself before seeing what other people
							have done to make progress on it. I seldom think I'm
							going to do anything groundbreaking, but that is
							actually a nice weight off my shoulders. It means I
							can just focus on having fun with the puzzle.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also as a fun aside, one of the papers (William H.
							Gates, Christos H. Papadimitriou, "
							<em> Bounds for sorting by prefix reversal </em>
							") which progressed this problem has a unique
							co-author. He's more widely known as "Bill" Gates.
							This is (as far as I know) the only mathematical
							publication he has ever been cited on.
