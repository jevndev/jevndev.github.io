						<h1>Some Background</h1>
						<p>
							Every warrior needs a weapon and every developer
							needs an overpriced laptop to run cli applications
							on. My weapon of choice is the Microsoft surface
							line of tablets. Ever since seeing a friend's
							surface 2 all the way back in 2013 I was
							<em> hooked </em>
							on the two-in-one form-factor. I've always been a
							fan of the idea of handwritten notes with the
							benefits of digital ones, so the kinds of workflows
							that a laptop/tablet hybrid could facilitate
							fascinated me. Many years later I found myself with
							a summer-internship's worth of disposable income to
							buy a surface pro 7 with. After going through most
							of college with a budget laptop I didn't really love
							to use, this was fantastic. I was going to crack out
							that bad-boy in a lecture hall and leaving all the
							pencil-and-paper cavemen in the dust. And though a
							niche world event that happened in 2020 made it so I
							had no lecture halls to go to, integrating the
							surface into my remote learning workflow was still
							very rewarding.
						</p>
						<p>
							Soon after graduating college, my surface pro 7
							became my "developer" workstation (separate from my
							gaming PC for the sake of boundaries and freedom to
							pick my work environment). But when I was developing
							at home, the portable laptop dock I used was clunky.
							Enter the Kensington SD7000 Surface Pro Docking
							Station
						</p>
						<p>
							<img

								src="Surface Dock Studio Mode.png"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							This was fantastic. It had all of the ports I needed
							and its main selling point was being able to
							transform from a floating tablet to a drafting table
							for handwriting/drawing
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Surface Dock Draft Mode.png"
								src="Surface Dock Draft Mode.png"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							At the time, this dock ran new for about \$400.
							Fortunately I found a local business liquidating
							some assets... which happened to include one of
							these guys (nearly unused) for \$100. After flooring
							it to the office complex where they were selling
							from and plugging it in, I had a pretty novel (but
							functional) desk setup.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Desk Setup With Surface Dock.jpg"
								src="Desk Setup With Surface Dock.jpg"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							(funny note: I managed to only have
							<strong> one </strong>
							image of this desk setup in my phone... and it's one
							of the few times I had the dock unplugged from the
							tablet. Incredible.)
						</p>
						<h1>The Problem</h1>
						<p>
							After a few years of service, my surface pro 7 was
							showing its age. Both because of the incredible rate
							that Microsoft can add bloat to windows over such a
							short time-span and because it was one of the lower
							spec tablets of its generation (It was only a
							<em> summer </em>
							internship salary, I couldn't shell out
							<strong> too </strong>
							much). I decided to upgrade to the surface pro 9
							near the end of 2023. Unfortunately the gods above
							(Random device designers at Microsoft) decided it
							was time to move the surface connect port about 3
							inches higher. This proprietary connector was how
							the Kensington dock hooked up and unfortunately it
							was designed only to work if that port was in the
							specific place that it was before this move. This
							rendered the dock completely useless. The tablet
							could still slide in and the pinout of the connector
							was the same. But the mechanism on the side of the
							dock which once engaged the connector now hopelessly
							rammed it into the side of the tablet. (see the
							little tumor on the right of the tablet in the above
							images).
						</p>
						<p>
							This was upsetting, a bit because I liked that
							form-factor but also because I didn't want a
							perfectly usable laptop dock to go to waste. I tried
							selling it for a year or so with no luck, but
							finally decided that i'd try to make it work for me
							again.
						</p>
						<p>
							So my initial thought was to just rip apart the
							housing of the tablet holder. My hope was that the
							designers left any slack in whatever cable was
							connecting the tablet to the main board of the dock.
							Ideally i'd just be able to pull it up, plug it in
							manually whenever I want to dock and be on my way.
							Maybe i'd even design and 3d print a new chassis for
							it to make it slightly cleaner to look at.
						</p>
						<p>In and out, 20 minute adventure</p>
						<h1>
							An Adventure That Was Certainly Longer Than 20
							Minutes
						</h1>
						<p>
							My first goal was to verify that this would work at
							all. A quick google search showed that the surface
							pro dock was still compatible... but I wanted to
							test to make sure. getting that connector assembly
							out should be easy, right? Immediately, no. In fact,
							there were only a few screws on the back panel of
							the tablet holder that I could get access to. After
							way too much finagling I managed to get off the
							panel and saw...
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Under Main Panel.jpg"
								src="Under Main Panel.jpg"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							An
							<em> extremely </em>
							chunky metal slider. This thing alone was easily a
							few pounds. I was able to wiggle it out. Sure
							enough:
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Working Connection.jpg"
								src="Working Connection.jpg"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							If you ignore my messy desk, everything looks great!
							Very good news.
						</p>
						<p>
							I then tore it open and was met with a sight I
							wasn't expecting
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Surface Connector.png"
								src="Surface Connector.png"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							When I came into this I thought I would see a raw
							PCB with contacts for the connector. I mean, why
							bother with a housing if you're not going to see it
							and it seemingly won't protect anything. But
							instead, we have a full fledged surface connector in
							here - chassis and all. Just like the ones you see
							on official Microsoft docks.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Surface Dock.png"
								src="Surface Dock.png"
							/>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is fantastic! I was expecting to have to
							heatshrink or 3d print a new housing for the
							connector but now I don't.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now that I have it out of the mechanism, I needed to
							look for some slack. But unfortunately the cable was
							pulled pretty taught. It slithered into one of the
							arms that held up the tablet mount and disappeared
							into it. So I figured if there was any slack I'd
							probably be able to find it in the base of the
							device. After (very) many more screws I tore into it
							only to find that the cable was taught. down there
							too. My first thought was to maybe route it outside
							the arm it was threaded through to get the extra
							length I needed. But that's when I noticed that it
							was encased in solid metal at the two ends of the
							arm. There was no way I was getting that connector
							(or the one which attached it to the main board)
							through.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img alt="Arm Base.png" src="Arm Base.png" />
						</p>
						<p>
							(as a fun aside, note that the Kensington lock here
							is just a piece of metal embedded in the side of the
							plastic casing. I really would have thought there
							would be something more secure on the device side)
						</p>
						<p>
							I saw the seam on the side of the arm and figured
							there was some way to take it apart... but no luck.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img alt="Arm.jpg" src="Arm.jpg" />
						</p>
						<p>
							I then found that the side of the arm was actually
							just a
							<strong> sticker </strong>
							. I tore it off and sure enough there were screws
							under.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this point, I had decimated the dock quite a bit.
							At this point, I figured my initial goal of putting
							it back together and using it as originally intended
							was more trouble that it was worth. So at this point
							I fully pulled it apart. Now the base of it sits on
							my desk.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img
								alt="Working Dock.jpg"
								src="Working Dock.jpg"

						</p>
						<p>
							I'm always happy to keep something out of a
							landfill. So this was a good exercise.
